## Upgrade Notice ##

We have a safe upgrade procedure that needs to be followed, specially if you have installed any add-ons to the main
plugin: [Important upgrade procedure for WP Customer Area](http://wp-customerarea.com/documentation/update-procedure/)

### Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x ###

Version 4 introduces a brand new menu system and breaks many templates that have been there in version 3.x. Coming 
from that version, you will need to create the pages that are necessary to display the private content types. Before
upgrading the plugin, backup your files and database. It is advised that you attempt the upgrade on a development 
site first.

## Installation ##

1. Nothing special, just upload the files, activate and you can then visit the settings page if you want. Like any 
other plugin
1. You need then to create a page and insert the [customer-area] shortcode. Your customers will be able to access their
private content on that page.
1. Finally, you will need to create content for the users (!): you can start with a private file for instance. Just 
check out the WordPress menu in your administration panel, you can add new customer files just like any post. Simply 
upload a file (below the content box), set the owner of that file, publish, and your customer should be able to see it.

**THIS IS A MAJOR UPDATE - PLEASE MAKE SOME TESTS ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SITES BEFORE UPGRADING YOUR LIVE WEBSITE**

* Completely changed the way information is displayed in the frontend. Now the plugin uses a system of pages similar to the one used by WooCommerce for example. 
This has allowed greater possibilities for customization (Widget areas, more templates to override, ...)
* The customer area main navigation menu now is a WordPress menu that can be customized just like any other WordPress menu (from the admin page: "Appearance" > "Menus")
* Restructured the options page. It now has less tabs and should group options in a more logical way. If you have commercial add-ons, you may need to enter their
license key again. These are available by logging-in with your credentials at http://www.marvinlabs.com/shop/your-account/
* Added category column in the admin page for private files and private pages (A pending feature request from several users)
* Refactored a lot of code to make the plugin ligher and more efficient. Should also reduce the amount of duplicated code and thus the potential hidden bugs. 
* Add possibility to include a function file in your Customer Area theme (See included frontend theme: default-v4). Works like WordPress' functions.php file for themes
except that this file should be located in your Customer Area theme folder (not the WordPress theme's folder) and it should be named 'cuar-functions.php'
